Map: it is key-value based collections
===

Features:
========
	- we can store the data in the form of 'key-value' fairs.
	- Map is an interface, we are unable to create instance for the interface. so that we need 
	  implementations classes.
	- Map collection implementation classes are,
				- HashMap
				- LinkedHashMap
				- TreeMap
				- Hashtable

HashMap:
   - it is an implementation class of Map collection.
   - used to store data in the form of 'key-value' fairs.
   - Support only unique keys, but supports duplicate values.
   - And also support one null key, and multiple null values.
   - it will not maintain the insertion order.
   
LinkedHashMap:
   - it is an implementation class of Map collection.
   - used to store data in the form of 'key-value' fairs.
   - Support only unique keys, but supports duplicate values.
   - And also support one null key, and multiple null values.
   - it will maintain the insertion order.   
   
TreeMap:
   - it is an implementation class of Map collection.
   - used to store data in the form of 'key-value' fairs.
   - Support only unique keys, but supports duplicate values.
   - And also not support null key, and multiple null values.
   - it will maintain ascending order.
   
Hashtable:
   - it is an implementation class of Map collection.
   - used to store data in the form of 'key-value' fairs.
   - Support only unique keys, but supports duplicate values.
   - And also not support null keys and null values.
   - it will not maintain the insertion order.
